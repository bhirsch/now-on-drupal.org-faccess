Package Access
----------------
By default all feature modules created by Features module are
assigned to the package called "Features" in the module's .info file. 
You can organize your features into feature sets by changing the value 
"Features" to something more meaningful like, "Events", "Media", "Front Page"
etc.

This module lets you restrict access to entire feature sets
or "packages" on the admin/build/features page.

Selected packages on admin/settins/paccess will be hidden
entirely from users.
